# Deep Neural Network Image Classifier

This image classifier app is trained on six classes and they are buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street.

You can upload images which fall under these classes and the app will attempt to classify them for you.

I use a pretrained VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network to classify the images.

I used Streamlit free sharing service (thanks Streamlit!) to deploy the app at:
